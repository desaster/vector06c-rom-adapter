# 2KB ROM Adapter for Vector-06C

To attach a 2KB rom to Vector-06c, normally you'd need to cut some traces and
add jumper wires. This mod attempts to eliminate the need to cut traces, and
minimizes the number of external wires.

Status: **~~UNTESTED~~, PROBABLY DANGEROUS ⚠️**

## How to build

1. Replace D9 on the V06C with a good dual wipe socket. Be careful, Vector-06C is delicate.
2. Add legs to the adapter board. Recommended to use thiner legs from "long leg female pin headers" to prevent damage to the socket.
3. Solder the two jumper wires of appropriate length to the adapter board, and connect them to the D1 chip on the Vector-06C.
4. Solder a double wipe socket to the adapter.
5. Add 2KB ROM chip to the adapter and enjoy.
