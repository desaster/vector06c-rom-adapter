# 2KB ROM Adapter for Vector-06C

To attach a 2KB rom to Vector-06c, normally you'd need to cut some traces and
add jumper wires. This mod attempts to eliminate the need to cut traces, and
minimizes the number of external wires.

Status: **~~UNTESTED~~, PROBABLY DANGEROUS ⚠️**

## How to build (theoretical, until proven successful)

1. Replace D9 on the V06C with a good dual wipe socket
2. Add legs to the adapter board. Recommended to use legs from "long leg female pin headers" to prevent damage to the socket.
3. Solder the two jumper wires of appropriate length to the adapter board.  Consider adding hooks for easy removability from V06C.
4. Solder a double wipe socket to the adapter
5. Add 2KB ROM chip and enjoy
